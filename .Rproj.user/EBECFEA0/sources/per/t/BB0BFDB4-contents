Description: Fits continuous-time random walk and correlated random walk state-space models for quality control animal tracking data ('Argos', processed light-level 'geolocation', 'GPS'). Template Model Builder ('TMB') is used for fast estimation. The 'Argos' data can be: (older) least squares-based locations; (newer) Kalman filter-based locations with error ellipse information; or a mixture of both. The models estimate two sets of location states corresponding to: 1) each observation, which are (usually) irregularly timed; and 2) user-specified time intervals (regular or irregular). Latent variable models are provided to estimate move persistence along tracks as an index of behaviour. Track simulation functions are provided.
