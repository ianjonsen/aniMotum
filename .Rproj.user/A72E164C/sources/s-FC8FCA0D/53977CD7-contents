# foieGras 1.0.0 (sometime soon)

* adds a move persistence model via `fit_ssm(model = "mp")` to allow simultaneous estimation of locations and move persistence. This approach may be preferable to using `fit_mpm()` on a `fit_ssm` model object. `fit_mpm()` is retained for historical purposes
* adds option for move persistence estimates to be normalised to 0,1 in `grab()`, either on tracks separately or as a group for a relative measure that spans 0 - 1. 
* adds `route_path()` a wrapper function calling [`pathroutr`](https://github.com/jmlondon/pathroutr) to re-route `fit_ssm` estimated or `simfit` simulated tracks around land barriers
* adds `sim_filter()` to calculate similarity between simulated and ssm-estimated tracks, and returns the most similar simulated tracks based on a user-specified quantile
* adds mapping function `map()` to replace `fmap()` for faster, more flexible estimated track maps & fixes to coastline and other mapping issues for tracks that cross -180,180
* adds rosm map tile layers to `map()` via `ggspatial::annotation_map_tile` for more detailed coastline mapping
* adds faster `crw` model fitting via `fit_ssm()` by turning off travel rate standard error (s.se) estimation in `ssm_control()` as the default. SE estimation can be turned on via `control = ssm_control(se = TRUE)`.
* adds a `summary` function for displaying information about SSM fits. 
* replaces hcl.colors("Zissou1") palette for most plots - Zissou1 was fun but not colour blind-friendly; in most cases "Cividis" is now the default but users can specify any `hcl.pals()` palette, using the `pal` argument in many of the plot functions.
* fit object s3 classes `fG_ssm`, `fG_mpm` migrated to `ssm_df`, `mpm_df`
* generic plot method s3 classes migrated to `plot.ssm_df`, `plot.mpm_df`, `plot.osar`, `plot.sim`, `plot.simfit`
* adds new vignettes for more comprehensive documentation of package features


# foieGras 0.7-6 (26/04/2021)

* adds fixes to example data for testing/examples so pkg builds on solaris and various linux boxes with older GDAL/PROJ libraries


# foieGras 0.7-5 (23/04/2021)

* adds `sim()` to simulate animal tracks using the `rw`, `crw` or `mpm` process models. The `rw` and `crw` models can also be specified with state-switching between multiple behavioural states. Tracks can be simulated with or without Argos (LS or KF) errors, as time-regular or time-irregular
* adds `simfit()` to simulate animal tracks from `fit_ssm` fit objects
* adds generic `plot()` methods for `sim` and `simfit` objects
* adds `fit_mpm` can take a `fit_ssm` object directly as input, removing need for user to manipulate data prior to calling `fit_mpm`
* adds `fit_mpm` can fit to SSM-`predicted` (time regular) or SSM-`fitted` (time irregular) locations, via `what` argument
* adds `fit_mpm` can fit to lon,lat or x,y coordinates, via `coords` argument
* adds `ssm_control()` for centralized control over optimizer and optimization method choices, optimizer parameters, and `foieGras` model parameter bounds
* adds faster and more stable optimization
* adds time-series and `acf()` plots as option when visualising prediction residuals calculated from `osar()`
* removes `hist` plots as option when visualising prediction residuals calculated from `osar()`
* removes (with deprecation errors) `verbose`, `optim`, `optMeth`, and `lpsi` arguments to `fit_ssm`
* replaces wesanderson::wes_palette("Zissou1") with hcl.colors("Zissou1") and provides arguments to change this default palette


# foieGras 0.6-9

* adds `wesanderson::wes_palette("Zissou1")` as default palette for plots/maps
* generic plot method for `fG_ssm` objects can now plot individuals all on 1 page (`pages = 1`) or on separate pages (`pages = 0`)
* 2-d (track) plots now include confidence ellipses on estimated locations
* generic plot method for `fG_mpm` objects now available
* mapping function (`fmap`) can optionally take an `fG_mpm` object to colour locations by behavioural index (`gamma_t`)


# foieGras 0.6-7

* adds ability to fit move persistence models to temporally regular OR irregular location data
* adds ability to turn off predicted locations by setting `time.step=NA` causing locations to be estimated only at observation times
* adds ability to fit to Argos - GPS or Argos - GLS locations simultaneously when combined in a single input data.frame
* adds ability to specify an alternate emf (Error Multiplication Factor) `data.frame` for Least-Squares and/or GPS locations
* adds human-readable/understandable errors and warnings with (occasional) advice
* turns off estimation of psi parameter (ellipse semi-minor axis re-scaling factor) when `rw` process model is fit to Argos KF/KS data
* removes reliance on `dplyr::do`, which is superseded as of `dplyr 1.0.0`
* replaces dplyr progressbar with parameter trace when fitting SSM to single or multiple data sets in default verbose mode 1
* replaces `argosfilter::sdafilter` in favour of `trip::sda` (which is a faster, vectorized version of the former) to prefilter outlier locations


# foieGras 0.4.0

* adds move persistence models for behavioural inference along animal tracks, via `fit_mpm()`
* adds ability to fit SSM's to processed light-level geolocation or GPS data by adding `lonerr, laterr` variables to input data
* adds One-Step-Ahead prediction residuals for evaluating SSM fits, via `osar()` and generic `plot()` method for `osar` output
* adds diagnostic plot functions that handle multi-individual fits, via generic `plot()` method for `fG_ssm` fit objects
* adds `sf`-enabled mapping function, via `fmap()`
* fixes CRAN check errors from last version, where proj4string syntax `+init:epsg=` was not supported in non-PROJ4 emulation mode on some linux platforms


# foieGras 0.2.2

# foieGras 0.2.1
